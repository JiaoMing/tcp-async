    <h2> Introduction </h2>

    <p>
        <b>tcp-async</b>, as the name implies, handles TCP connections reactively using
        <a href="http://www.akka.io" target="_blank">Akka I/O</a>. It also makes reactive API calls using
        <a href="http://spray.io/documentation/1.2-M8/spray-client/">spray-client</a>, and non-blocking SQL DB
        operations
        using <a href="https://github.com/mauricio/postgresql-async">postgresql/mysql-async</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thanks to akka-io, <code>tcp-async</code> can serve high amount of requests concurrently.
        Whole application is designed to be reactive top to bottom.
    </p>

    <p>
        A few options for handling requests is already created for you. Basic echo handler is the simplest, but there
        are other handlers as well; writing incoming data to a MySQL database, and making an API call.
    </p>

    <p>
        All those handlers are reactive, and based on some open source libraries which will be mentioned later.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lets start with the server now.
    </p>

    <h2> Waiting For Clients: Server</h2>

    <p>
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/server/Server.scala" class="shortcut">Server</a>
        is an actor waiting for connections which can be made over HTTP, TCP or UDP. You should implement a Server actor
        for the type you wish to use. <code>tcp-async</code> comes with a built in
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/server/TcpServer.scala" class="shortcut">TcpServer</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each <a href="#code/src/main/scala/server/Server.scala" class="shortcut">Server</a>
        actor binds to an InetSocketAdress. In this case,
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/server/TcpServer.scala" class="shortcut">TcpServer</a>
        listens for incoming Tcp connections with the following binding:
    </p>

    <pre><code>IO(Tcp) ! Tcp.Bind(self, new InetSocketAddress(appHostName, appPort))</code></pre>

    <p>
        Just below that, you can see <code>receive</code> function:
    </p>

<pre><code>override def receive = {
    case Tcp.CommandFailed(_: Tcp.Bind) => context stop self

    case Tcp.Connected(remote, local) =>
    val handler = context.actorOf(handlerProps.props(sender))
    sender ! Tcp.Register(handler)
}
</code></pre>

    <p>
        When an actor is bound to an InetSocketAddress, it either receives a CommandFailed or a Connected message.
        <code>CommandFailed</code> message is sent if there was an error binding to the given InetSocketAddress.
        <code>Connected</code> message is sent whenever there is a client requesting for a connection. Every connection
        must have its own <a href="#code/src/main/scala/handler/Handler.scala" class="shortcut">Handler</a> to process
        incoming data without blocking the server. This is done by creating a new handler actor and registering that
        handler to the current connection by sending a <code>Register</code> message.
    </p>

    <p>
        The key part here is that connection with sender(client) is not managed by Server actor itself.
        Every connection is handled by a Handler actor instance.
        Thus the Server actor is free to get new connections, and indeed, a simple load test shows that 10K requests can
        be easily handled by tcp-async.
    </p>

    <p><i>
        Remember, 10K actors doesn't mean 10K threads.
    </i></p>

    <p>
        Now lets move on to Handlers.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Deciding What To Do: Handler</h2>

    <p>
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/handler/Handler.scala" class="shortcut">Handler</a> is an Actor which
        deals with the client connection and decides what to do with incoming requests.
    </p>

    <p>
        Handler takes sender actor as a parameter. Communication with the remote client is performed using this actor.
<pre><code>abstract class Handler(val connection: ActorRef) extends Actor {
    // ...
}</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Looking further into the code, you will see that there are six different messages that can be consumed, five of
        which is actually related to the way the connection is closed, and last one is about the incoming data. Quickly
        summarizing the first five,
    </p>
<pre>
    PeerClosed      => Closed from remote endpoint
    ErrorClosed     => Closed because of an error
    Closed          => Closed as a response to Close message
    ConfirmedClosed => Closed as a response to ConfirmedClose message
    Aborted         => Closed as a response to Abort message
</pre>

    <p>
        You can read more details about the ways to close a Tcp connection and further explanation of each message from
        <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.1/scala/io-tcp.html#closing-connections" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Continuing with the more exciting part of handling incoming data, we should check for the <code>Received</code>
        message. Received message contains a ByteString as you might expect, and its up to the handler to give that
        ByteString a meaning. Here for the purposes of this tutorial we decode the ByteString into String using UTF-8,
        trim any whitespaces and call <code>received</code> function with it. Here is how its done,
<pre><code>def receive: Receive = {
  case Received(data) =>
    data.utf8String.trim match {
      // ...
      case str => received(str)
    }
  // ...
}</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        Concrete handler classes should implement the <code>received</code> function, processing the incoming data as
        they please. Lets see a simple example, an echoing handler.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Repeat After Me: EchoHandler</h2>

    <p>
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/handler/EchoHandler.scala" class="shortcut">EchoHandler</a>,
        as you can guess, echoes incoming message.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is achieved by sending a Write message to the connection actor. Write message requires a ByteString to be
        sent over the connection, and as an EchoHandler, incoming data is given as the ByteString.
    </p>

    <pre><code>def received(data: String) = connection ! Write(ByteString(data + "\n"))</code></pre>

    <p>
        Since abstract <a href="#code/src/main/scala/handler/Handler.scala" class="shortcut">Handler</a> does bulk of
        the task for us, EchoHandler is plain simple.
    </p>

    <h3>Running EchoHandler</h3>

    <p>
        Hey, you should be wondering how you can run and test EchoHandler now. Don't worry its already done for you.
        Go ahead and check <a href="#code/src/main/scala/Main.scala" class="shortcut">MainWithEchoHandler</a>, you will
        see that it simply creates an
        <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.1/general/actor-systems.html" target="_blank">ActorSystem</a> for
        Server and Handler actors to live within, then it fires up a TcpServer actor, giving in
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/handler/EchoHandler.scala" class="shortcut">EchoHandlerProps</a> as a parameter.
        You may run this MainWithEchoHandler now, just go to <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a>, and make sure you
        pick the correct main class from the list.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once, its up and running, all you have to do is to connect and send some data in. Here is an example session
        using <code>telnet</code>:
    </p>

<pre>#Connect on default host and port
telnet localhost 9999
telnet> Hello World!
Hello World!
telnet> close
Connection closed by foreign host.</pre>

    <p>
        You should try it on your own now. Keep in mind that you can have as many connections as you wish, try opening
        up more than one telnet sessions. You may also want to try different keywords for closing (Abort, Close,
        ConfirmedClose). Come back once you are done!
    </p>

    <p>
        Lets move on to a more complex example, shall we?
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Ground Control To Major Tom: ApiHandler</h2>

    <p>
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/handler/ApiHandler.scala" class="shortcut">ApiHandler</a>
        makes Api calls to
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/elevation/">Google Elevation Api</a>.
        Google elevation api simply returns the elevation of given coordinates.
    </p>

    <p>
        Just like in EchoHandler, <code>received</code> function is implemented to handle incoming data, which is
        assumed to be coordinates now. What it does is to basically create a URL using the API url and incoming
        coordinates, and then do a non-blocking HTTP request and Write'ing out the response of the API.
    </p>

    <p>
        You may have already noticed that <a href="#code/src/main/scala/api/Api.scala" class="shortcut">Api</a> object
        is used for making the HTTP request. Api object is a wrapper for
        <a href="http://spray.io/documentation/1.2-M8/spray-client/" target="_blank">spray-client</a>, in which we
        create an HttpRequest instance via <code>createHttpRequest</code> function and use that instance in a pipeline
        to do the actual request in a reactive fashion.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that <code>sendAndReceive</code> produces an anonymous function with type
        <code>(HttpRequest) => Future[HttpResponse]</code> which you can make your HTTP request with.
    </p>

    <h3>Running ApiHandler</h3>

    <p>
        Well, you are experienced now, don't you? Go ahead and <a href="#run" class="shortcut">run</a>
        MainWithApiHandler and see it in action. Here is a sample session to guide you, just make sure you enter the
        coordinates in latitude,longitude form:
    </p>

<pre>#Connect on default host and port
telnet localhost 9999
telnet> 28.976,41.014
{
   "results" : [
      {
         "elevation" : 752.8604736328125,
         "location" : {
            "lat" : 28.976,
            "lng" : 41.014
         },
         "resolution" : 152.7032318115234
      }
   ],
   "status" : "OK"
}

telnet> close
Connection closed by foreign host.</pre>

    <p>
        Hey, there is one more handler before we wrap it up. Up to now, you see how to handle incoming requests
        reactively, and also how to make API calls to remote services reactively. I know its already delicious, but how
        about adding some reactive DB operations on top as icing? Just follow the lead...
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Remember, Remember: DbHandler</h2>

    <p>
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/handler/DbHandler.scala" class="shortcut">DbHandler</a>
        writes incoming message to a MySQL database and returns all the data in database to sender.
    </p>

    <p><b>Note: In order to use DbHandler, you must have a MySQL Database and valid
        database configuration for it. You see the details of configuration on the next page.
    </b></p>

    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/mauricio/postgresql-async">postgresql/mysql-async</a>
        is used as MySql driver.
    </p>

    <h3>postgresql/mysql-async</h3>

    <p>
        <code>postgresql/mysql-async</code> is an async, Netty based database driver for MySQL and PostgreSQL written in
        Scala.
    </p>

    <p>
        Under <a href="#code/src/main/scala/db" class="shortcut">db</a> folder, there are two objects, Pool and DB.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/db/Pool.scala" class="shortcut">Pool</a>
        defines a connection pool for using database and keeps certain amount of connections ready to
        use. If the pool has available connections, it will execute the given queries immediately, otherwise queries
        will be pushed into a queue to be executed in future. Pool throws a <code>PoolExhaustedException</code> whenever
        the queue is full (queue size is defined in
        <a href="#code/src/main/resources/application.conf" class="shortcut">application.conf</a>)
        Connections are returned back to pool after execution is done.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/db/DB.scala" class="shortcut">DB</a>
        is used to execute queries using Pool.
    </p>

<pre><code>def execute(query: String, values: Any*): Future[QueryResult] = {
  if (values.size > 0)
    pool.sendPreparedStatement(query, values)
  else
    pool.sendQuery(query)
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        If there are values to be set, then the query is assumed to be a prepared statement and is executed with given
        values bound. Otherwise, the query is executed on the Db as is, which means that there is no parameter binding,
        nor prepared statement.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you only need <code>Seq[RowData]</code>, you can use <code>fetch</code>:
    </p>

<pre><code>def fetch(query: String, values: Any*): Future[Option[Seq[RowData]]] =
  execute(query, values: _*).map(_.rows)</code></pre>

    <p>
        <code>fetch</code> is used as part of
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/handler/DbHandler.scala" class="shortcut">DbHandler</a>, where the latest state
        of the table is sent back through the connection.
    </p>

    <h3>Running DbHandler</h3>

    <p>
        This one is a bit different. First of all, it requires a MySQL server. Then, the SQLs from
        <a href="#code/src/main/resources/setup.sql.conf" class="shortcut">setup.sql.conf</a> should be executed
        in order to create the database and table that this handler uses. Finally,
        <a href="#code/src/main/resources/application.conf" class="shortcut">application.conf</a> should be updated to
        reflect your MySQL settings.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are all set, just <a href="#run" class="shortcut">run</a> MainWithDbHandler and see it in action.

        Here is a sample session to guide you:
    </p>

<pre>#Connect on default host and port
telnet localhost 9999
telnet> testing
values in db are:
testing--Sun Sep 22 23:04:54 UTC 2013
telnet> Hello World!
values in db are:
testing--Sun Sep 22 23:04:54 UTC 2013
Hello World!--Sun Sep 22 23:05:03 UTC 2013
telnet> close
Connection closed by foreign host.</pre>

    <p>
        There you have it. All your messages are recorded and listed back to you with dates appended, and all of this
        happens in a reactive way, without blocking any thread.
    </p>

    <p>
        Rest of this tutorial will tell you a bit more about the configuration of this application, and list some next
        steps for you to enjoy. Oh by the way, if you want to remove all traces of messages you sent, just execute the
        SQL from <a href="#code/src/main/resources/destroy.sql.conf" class="shortcut">destroy.sql.conf</a>.
    </p>

</div>

<div>
    <h2>Configuration</h2>

    <p> Configuration parameters of the application can be found in
        <a href="#code/src/main/resources/application.conf" class="shortcut">application.conf</a>.
        Considering the size of this application, having a single configuration file helps keeping it concise.
        Configuration is organized hierarchically into 4 parts, namely tcp-async, app, api and db.
    </p>

    <p>
        When the application starts, configuration is loaded into the
        <a href="#code/src/main/scala/util/Conf.scala" class="shortcut">Conf</a> object.
        Its always a good practice to load configuration parameters into the Conf object and read them through it.
        Mainly because the values can be validated and replaced with defaults in case of an illegal parameter value,
        and it also prevents application to read <code>.conf</code> file every time.
